# Minestest-mod-Rythium
New material, new possibilities, new gameplay


## Quick project overview

Add a new material called rythium that grow on Rythmics trees that you can grow with mineral_fertilized_dirt (with diamond and mithril)
With this material you can craft unique objects like a 3 * 3 pickaxe.

* If we melt a diamond diamond_powder is obtained
* Same for a mithril ingot
* We take 1 of dirt with above and below the diamond_powder and to the right and left of the mithril_powder : we obtain mineral_fertilized_dirtfertilized_
* We put it with water around and we plant a rhythmic sapling (I have to think about how we get the rhythmic sapling)
* The rhythmic sapling will grow as it consumes the mineral fertilized dirt
* We get a rhythmic tree on which rhythium_nuggets will grow
* With 9 rhythium nuggets: 1 rhythium ingot
* And with these rhythium ingots we can make unique items / tools

## TODO

* create textures
* create nodes
* create recipes
* create tools
* register rythmic_tree using default tree API ?
