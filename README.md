## Quick project overview

Add a new material called rythium that grow on rythium trees that you can grow with mineral_dirt (with diamond and mithril)
With this material you can craft unique objects like a 3 * 3 pickaxe.

### How to ?

* Melt a diamond in furnace: you get diamond_powder
* Same for a mithril ingot: you get mithril_powder
* Craft 9 mineral dirt (0 = empty; Dp = diamnond_powder; Mp = mithril_powder; Di = default:dirt)

* Make a 3x3 square with it and surround with water
* Plant the rythium sapling in the middle : it will consume the mineral dirt as it grows

* With 9 rythium nuggets craft a rythium ingot
* And with these rythium ingots you may craft unique items/tools

When used, the healing wand will cure the aimed player, who will get 20 hit points again.

If no player is aimed, the user is cured.

The wand has a limited number of charges (default 20, mays be changed in the mod options)
