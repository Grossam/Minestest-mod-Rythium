# rythium
New material, new possibilities, new gameplay


## Quick project overview

Add a new material called rythium that grow on rythium trees that you can grow with mineral_dirt (with diamond and mithril)
With this material you can craft unique objects like a 3 * 3 pickaxe.

* If we melt a diamond diamond_powder is obtained
* Same for a mithril ingot
* We take 1 of dirt with above and below the diamond_powder and to the right and left of the mithril_powder : we obtain mineral_dirt
* We put it with water around and we plant a rythium sapling
* The rythium sapling will grow as it consumes the mineral fertilized dirt
* We get a rythium tree on which rythium_nuggets will grow
* With 9 rythium nuggets: 1 rythium ingot
* And with these rythium ingots we can make unique items / tools
