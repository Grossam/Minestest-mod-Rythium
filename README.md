# Minestest-mod-Rythium
New material, new possibilities, new gameplay

Add a new material called rythium that graw on Rythmics trees that you can graw with mineral fertilized dirt (with diamond and mithril)
With this material you can craft unique objects like a 3 * 3 pickaxe

If we melt a diamond
Diamond powder is obtained
Same for a mithril ingot
(will have to put moreores in depend.txt)
We take 1 of dirt with Above and below the diamond powder and to the right and left of the mithril powder
We obtain mineral fertilized dirt
We put it with water around
and we plant a rhythmic sapling
(I have to think about how we get the rhythmic sapling)
The rhythmic sapling will grow as it consumes the mineral fertilized dirt as it goes.
To create a rhythmic tree
On which will grow rhythium nuggets
With 9 rhythium nuggets: 1 rhythium ingot
And with these rhythium ingots we can make unique items / tools
